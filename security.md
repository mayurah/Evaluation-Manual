Though evaluation would be done based on contribution made by candidates in respective domain, here are Some of the evaluation paramenters for security hackathon.

## Cyber Security ðŸ›¡

- Completeness of submission
- Quality of submitted solution
- Understanding of the problem
- Extra points:
-- Innovative approach
-- Going extra mile to build PoC for exploit
-- build wireframe or flow to further explain the solution/hack,
-- Finding unknown vulnerability which wasn't part of the CTF
-- Documentation, Robust Design and architectural knowledge
-- Deployment and Live Demo

â€”

Raw Evaluation Understanding for Safety of Docker containers in Cloud, Splunk SIEM, VA/PT  and overall Cybersecurity events.

I. Candidates would submit their research and findings on three of the domains on HackerEarth platform.

II. Once the event is over, subject-matter expert will evaluate each of the candidate's submission given on domains.

III. As an outcome, we would get efficiency of each candidate on each of the domain and cumulative ranking on how good they're with respective domains.

For example, Say candidate X has 70% in Slunk,  50% on VA/PT and 90% on Cloud.

Hope that helps understand evaluation criteria for Hybrid Security event.
