# Evaluation Manual

> Guideline and criteria for evaluating hackathon and code sprint globally conducted by developer friendly companies 

> Here are the current evaluation parameters that we have listed, which we use at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

> Please feel free to fork this repo and add more aspects which would help evaluate hackathons and code sprint events involving aspects such as innovation, code, design and user experience.

**Four core parameters**:

* [Idea](https://github.com/mayurah/Evaluation-Manual/blob/master/idea.md)
* Code
* Design
* Overall Usability

**Note**: Weightage for each aspect is given 10 by default, but can be balanced and changed as per requirement.

## Idea/Conceptualization (Important for hackathons)

- Creativity and Innovation aspects
- Viability of Idea and overall effectiveness on relevant domain
- If there's already existing solution available to proposed idea
- Problem Solution, Business Model, Impact

## Design/Wireframe/Blueprints

- Elaborative self-explanatory design
- Any interactive and creativity from design perspective
- Subtle patterns / Textures / Elegant design / Icons / Typography
- Use of current tech (2016) such as React, eletron.atom.io, AngularJS, Material Design, Flat Icons, etc.
- Use of UI / UX / CSS3 and HTML5 features in case of web/mobile development

## Code/Scalability

- Coding standard, beautified and well-maintained code, external libraries
- Algorithms, Web API, creativity, logic, framework, network communication
- Use of version control, demo url and deployment tools to make development operations easier
- [Documentation](https://github.com/mayurah/Evaluation-Manual/blob/master/sample-deployment-instructions.md), Collaborative tools and devOps automation
- Have a look at [Data Science](https://github.com/mayurah/Evaluation-Manual/blob/master/data-science.md) for sub-parameters used for evaluating data science submission

## Overall Usability

- Overall functionality of the submission
- Use of sane labels/text/context/design which would make sense
- Added efforts/features/value to the overall work (video, presentation, etc).
- Embracing innovation/idea/task in mind
- Lesser bugs


**PS**: This paper is made for and used at HackerEarth for the evaluation process of Hackathon and Hiring challenges.
