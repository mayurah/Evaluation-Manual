# Idea Submission // Hackathon Evaluation Parameters

> This is a evaluation guideline/documentation for idea submission phase, where candidate may or may not have worked on functional prototype, but would have idea and possible execution plan to make such innovative ideas into prototype.

**Sample Splitup/Breakdown:**

* Idea : 15
* Complexity : 10
* Impact : 10
* Creativity : 5

**Idea**

- Innovativeness of the idea
- Relevance of pain points Idea is trying to address
- If there's already existing solution available to proposed idea
- Maturity of technology used

**Complexity**

- calability and overall Difficulty/Complexity of proposed Idea
- Elaborative self-explanatory design
- Use of sane contextual presentation of idea which would make sense

-  Use of specific SDK(s) or particular domain inclining with client's dominancy (i.e. Mechanical / Machinary Automation / Robotics)

**Creativity**

- i.e. To demonstrate a very creatively presented idea received by us in IndiaHacks, please follow this [youtube (microGiant)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekZYqJPM8RU&feature=youtu.be) link.

**Impact**

- Problem Solution, Business Model (if any), Impact and relevance to Indian masses
   - Explanation (Business Model): We have seen in certain cases that candidates come up with Idea along with the actual plan on how they can convert prototypes/ideas into a business in the near future. Hence, we had put the business angle. However, we can check if we shall use this parameter as measurable metrics.
- Viability in Indian context.
- What technological platforms candidate has tried to cover? The more technological platforms covered, the more number of potential users of the idea


â€” **Note:** This is raw guideline, and can be altered/customized as per the requirement and mutual discussion between Client and Evaluation Team.
