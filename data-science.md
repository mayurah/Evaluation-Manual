# Data Science // Evaluation Parameters

> This is an evaluation guideline/documentation for data science submissions, where candidate must have worked on functional prototype, and would have visualisations, data points and possible code to back the analsis/findings.

**Sample Splitup/Breakdown:**

* Code : 15
* Graphs/Visualization/Maps : 10
* Usability : 10

**Code**

- Functionality and efficiency of the code and a choosen method (i.e. Python, R, Tableau, SAS, Microsoft BI, etc.)
- If the solution covers valid ternds, data points and/or statistical analysis on given problem/dataset
- Relevance of data points and produced output w.r.t. data analysis, processing, probability and statistics

**Graphs/Visualization/Charts/Maps**

- Use of sane and relevant Graph/Chart (Pareto/Bar, Pie/Circle, Histogram, Dot Plot, Scatter, Line, Cosmographs, Area, Waterfall, Radar, Bubble, etc)
- Elaborative self-explanatory design
- Use of Maps/Visualization (Comparisons, Proportions, Relationships, Hierarchy, Distribution, Movement/Flow, Pattern, Geographical, Vector, Heat, etc) whereever required

**Usability (Findings/Impact/Validation)**

- How creative is the finding from the analytical point of view; and is it what we've asked for, is it more than what we've asked for; and other supporting deliverables submitted by the candidate
- Validation of user submitted findings with existing answers set by problem setter/data scientist
- Use of cloud providers, available resources and/or delivering more than what has been asked
- Extra efforts/Uniqueness/creativity in given submission(s)
